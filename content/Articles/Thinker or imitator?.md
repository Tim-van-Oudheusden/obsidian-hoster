# Introduction
This article is inspired by a recent video of [Northernlion](https://www.youtube.com/@Northernlion) that created a chain of thoughts in my mind. How many of your opinions are yours truly? And how many thoughts are based on what the mainstream consensus is? Even complot theory believers (e.g. flat earth) are a paradigm of this behavior, the only difference being a drive for a feeling of pre-eminence. 

# A thought challenge
There are many things we consider inherently bad as a society, and the explanation for some are very apparent. Take drunk driving for example, obviously the fact that a decrease in motor function and awareness in a high speed vehicle poses a great threat to others, therefore it is punished severely. However, let's take a look at a more nuanced topic: hobbies. Why is dancing considered feminine? Why is liking cars considered masculine? Why is the opposite sex having an interest in these considered peculiar? Because society sad so? And how often have you asked yourself the "why" question for these topics?

# The curious mind in a black and white world
In my personal vault of notes I have a folder with all my "core values" that I put together after a very long session of introspection and my work from [[Yoga Nidra, a way to be at peace in chaos|Yoga Nidra]]. And by doing so, I can now draw a line from every action I take back to one of these core values. And I challenge you to do the same. 

A good way to start is by looking at your past actions, and analyzing why you made the choices you did. For example: all my life I have felt immense anger when a pet is harmed, nothing infuriates me more. This also extends to plants, as I feel an intense sadness when a healthy plant is forcibly removed for no good reason. Therefore, one of my core values is to: "Never harm defenseless beings".

# How a thoughtful mind can enrich your quality of life
If you were to take a math test, and I would give you a list of formulas that can be used to get the answers, would you not say that the test would be easier? The same applies to the choices you make in life. If you truly know what you care about, decisions becomes much easier and options become less convoluted. I know I love to spend the evening painting, or trying an innovative strategy in a board game, because innovation and creativity are one of my primary sources of happiness. What about you?

# An assignment, if you will
Take an evening or two and try to come up with at least five things you truly care about. Start by working from past experiences, and after defining a core value, try to look at a future choice that stems from this core value. And if you desire to care about something else, consider practicing [[Yoga Nidra, a way to be at peace in chaos|Yoga Nidra]].
